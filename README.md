### [Data Visualization](https://data-visualization.squibs.vercel.app/) (Click to view functional site)

<em>Completed October 24, 2022</em>

A single site that is a collection of all the [D3](https://d3js.org/) projects I created that are required to get the freeCodeCamp _Data Visualization_ certification ([my certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/squibs/data-visualization)).

Each of these charts pulls in the data from various freeCodeCamp supplied GitHub endpoints / repositories via fetch requests. The data is then processed through the use of D3 to provide a visualization of the data.
